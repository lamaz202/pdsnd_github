### Project Title

Python project 

### Description
I used the programming language Python to explore data on bike-sharing systems for three major cities in the US - Chicago, New York and Washington, and wrote code to import the data and answer interesting questions about it by calculating descriptive statistics. I've also written a script that takes raw input to create an interactive experience in the device to present these stats.
